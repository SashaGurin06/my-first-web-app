        <p>In today's digital world, data is one of the most valuable assets. With cyberattacks growing in frequency and complexity, organizations need to stay one step ahead of hackers. 
            This is where ethical hacking comes in.</p>
            <p>Ethical hacking, also known as white-hat hacking, is the practice of testing systems, networks, and applications to uncover vulnerabilities before malicious hackers can exploit them. Unlike cybercriminals, ethical hackers have permission to test and break into systems — with the goal of protecting them, not harming them.</p>

            <h2><a name ="2">Why Ethical Hacking Matters</a></h2>
        <p>Every organization that handles sensitive information — from banks and hospitals to schools and tech companies — is a potential target for cyberattacks. A single data breach can cost millions, damage reputations, and put users at risk.Ethical hackers help prevent these disasters by:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Simulating real-world attacks (penetration testing)</li>
            <li>Identifying weak points in security systems</li>
            <li>Helping developers patch bugs and fix flaws</li>
            <li>Training teams on secure practices</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In short, they act as a digital defense force — constantly testing the walls so attackers can’t break them.</p>

        <h2><a name ="3">What Ethical Hackers Do</a></h2>
        <p>Ethical hackers use the same tools and techniques as malicious hackers, but always with legal approval. Their work may include:</p>
            <ol  type="I">
                <li>Scanning networks for vulnerabilities</li>
                <li>Testing web applications for SQL injection or XSS attacks</li>
                <li>Bypassing authentication systems</li>
                <li>Reporting findings in detailed security reports</li>
                <li>Working with IT teams to strengthen defenses</li>
            </ol>
            <p>They often follow guidelines set by frameworks like OWASP, NIST, or ISO/IEC 27001.</p>

            <p>To become a professional ethical hacker, you need a strong foundation in IT, networking, and cybersecurity.
                 Many ethical hackers are certified with credentials like:</p>
                 <ol>
                    <li>CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker)</li>
                    <li>OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional)</li>
                    <li>CompTIA Security+</li>
                 </ol>
                 <p>Beyond technical skills, ethical hackers must have a deep sense of integrity, responsibility, and a strong understanding of cyber laws and ethics.</p>
